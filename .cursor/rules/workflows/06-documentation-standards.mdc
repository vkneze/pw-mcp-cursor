# ðŸ“„ Documentation & Commenting Standards

- Add a JSDoc block (`/** ... */`) immediately **after imports** and before `test.describe()` in test files.
- Add a JSDoc block at the top of every page file describing its purpose.
- For helper functions, document inputs, outputs, and purpose.
- Use inline `//` comments only when necessary for clarity.
