# ðŸ§ª Test Best Practices

- Follow the **Arrange â†’ Act â†’ Assert** pattern.
- Use `test.describe()` for grouping related tests.
- Use `beforeEach()` for common setup (navigation, login, etc.).
- Each test should verify one specific behavior.
- Do not put locators directly to tests or functions. Put them in page constructor.
- Flaky tests must include a `@flaky` tag before test name and a comment explaining why test is flaky.
