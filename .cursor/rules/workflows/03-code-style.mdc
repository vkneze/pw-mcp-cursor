# ðŸŽ¨ Code Style Rules

- Use `async/await` for all Playwright actions.
- Prefer `const` unless reassignment is required.
- Always use `expect()` for validation.
- Use ID locators before CSS selectors.
- Prefer the most stable locators:
  1. ID (`#id`)
  2. `[data-testid]`
  3. ARIA role + name
  4. Visible text
  5. Attribute selector
  6. CSS class
  7. XPath or positional
